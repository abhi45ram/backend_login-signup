There are two folders: one for the backend and the other for the client.
Before starting, install node_module in both folder.
To start the client application, navigate to the client directory by executing:
cd frontend and ng serve

For the backend server, navigate to the root directory using the command:
cd.. and node server.js

Make sure to configure your MongoDB local server URL, typically mongodb://localhost:27017/
